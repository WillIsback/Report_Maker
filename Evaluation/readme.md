Creating a WordPress website for manual evaluation involves several steps. Here's a general approach:

1. **Set Up WordPress**: Choose a free hosting provider that supports WordPress, like WordPress.com, 000webhost, or InfinityFree. Follow their instructions to set up a new WordPress site.

2. **Create Evaluation Form**: Use a WordPress plugin like WPForms or Formidable Forms to create a new form for evaluations. The form should include a field for the evaluator to enter their name, a dropdown to select the report they're evaluating, and 10 rating fields for different aspects of the report. Each rating field should allow a score from 1 to 5 or 1 to 10, depending on your preference.

3. **Publish Evaluation Form**: Add the evaluation form to a new page on your WordPress site. You can do this by creating a new page and adding the form to the page using the plugin's shortcode.

4. **Collect Responses**: The form plugin should automatically collect responses and provide a way for you to view them. Check the plugin's documentation for details.

5. **Analyze Results**: Once you've collected enough responses, analyze the results to compare the performance of the different models. This could involve calculating average scores for each model or performing statistical tests to determine if differences in scores are significant.

Need to provide clear instructions to your evaluators about how to rate the reports. Also providing training to evaluators to ensure they understand how to use the rating system.
