# Evaluation of Text Summarization Models

In this document, we compare the performance of two language models for text summarization: Gemma and GPT. We evaluate the models based on the quality of the generated summaries and the time taken to generate the summaries.

## Model 1: Gemma

The Gemma model generated the summary found in [this report](reports/gemma_report_5mn_output.md).

The time taken by the Gemma model to generate the summary is shown in the figure below:
